The Terraform configuration provided provisions a simple AWS architecture 
to run an Nginx web server on an Amazon EC2 instance and expose it to the internet. 
Here's a breakdown of the architecture:

1. **Amazon EC2 Instance:**
   - An Amazon EC2 instance is launched using the specified Amazon Linux 2 AMI. 
   This instance runs an Nginx web server, serving a basic "Hello from Nginx on AWS EC2!" webpage.

2. **Security Group:**
   - A security group is created to control inbound and outbound traffic to the EC2 instance.
   - Inbound rule allows HTTP traffic (port 80) from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0).
   - Outbound rule allows all traffic.

3. **User Data Script:**
   - The EC2 instance is configured using a user data script.
   - The script updates the system, installs Nginx, starts the Nginx service, 
   and creates a simple HTML page.

4. **Output:**
   - An output is defined to display the public IP address of the EC2 instance.

In summary, the architecture consists of a single EC2 instance running Nginx, 
accessible from the public internet via its public IP address. 
The security group ensures that only HTTP traffic (port 80) is allowed to 
reach the instance. It's a simple setup suitable for serving static content via Nginx. 
For a more robust and scalable architecture, additional components such as load balancers, 
auto-scaling groups, and a domain configuration would be added.
